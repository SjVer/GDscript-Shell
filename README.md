A simple interactive shell for GDscript

The aim of this project is mainly for me to practice coding. C# in particular. Next to that, this is supposed to be a convinient GDScript version of e.g. python's IDLE interactive shell.

If you have any comments please make them or send them to sjoerd@marsenaar.com. Thanks!

# Operating system and languages
This application is fully being created on linux, and I cannot say anything about compatibility with other OS'es or even other linux distros than the one I'm working on, simply because I don't know a whole lot about that topic. This application is mainly written in C#, but contains some python, shell and other stuff here and there. The gdscript files are simply example scripts.

# Credits
For the code execution i used williamd1ko's [gdscript-cli](https://github.com/williamd1k0/gdscript-cli) project. This code is (apart from line 45 in gdscript/gdscript.py) completely untouched and can be found in the directory Assets/gdscript-cli. The README, license, etc. are included.
