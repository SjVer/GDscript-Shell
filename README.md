# GDscript-Shell
A simple interactive shell for GDscript

The aim of this project is mainly for me to practice coding. C# in particular. Next to that, this is supposed to be a convinient GDScript version of e.g. python's IDLE interactive shell.

If you have any comments please make them or send them to sjoerd@marsenaar.com. Thanks!
